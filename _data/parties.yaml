    the Official Unionist Party (OUP) or, in a historic sense, simply the Unionist
    Party – is the older of the two main unionist political parties in Northern Ireland.
    Before the split in unionism in the late 1960s, when the former Protestant Unionist
    Party began to attract more hardline support away from the UUP, it governed Northern
    Ireland between 1921 and 1972 as the sole major unionist party.'
